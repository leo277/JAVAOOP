/* *******************
*Interfaces have the following properties:
*-An interface is implicitly abstract. You do not need to use the abstract keyword while declaring an interface.
*-Each method in an interface is also implicitly abstract, so the abstract keyword is not needed.
*-Methods in an interface are implicitly public.
